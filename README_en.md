#### Evaluation Method
* In order to balance costs, we primarily utilize GPT4 for evaluation. As described in [QLoRA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14314), the comparative randomness in model comparisons solely based on GPT4 scores is substantial. This aligns with our observations. Therefore, we have adopted the widely used Elo Rating tournament evaluation method, as recommended by [QLoRA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14314).

#### Evaluation Datasets [[eval/data]](eval/data)
* MedQA_Mainland: Extracting 150 samples from the Mainland/test subset of [MedQA](https://github.com/jind11/MedQA).
* PromptCBLUE: Extracting 150 samples from the test subset of [PromptCBLUE](https://github.com/michael-wzhu/PromptCBLUE).
<!-- * detailedMedQA: A private datset with detailed answers to 98 commonly medical domain questions. -->

* [DoctorGLM](https://github.com/xionghonglin/DoctorGLM) (p-tuningv2)


#### Hyperparameter Selection
* For cost considerations, we chose to perform 360 rounds of random evaluation on each dataset. The order in which models compete against each other in the PK (player versus player) matches was randomized to counteract any order-related bias, with a random seed set to 42. The implementation code for the Elo rating and other hyperparameters can be referred to in Vicuna's Elo code: [link to Vicuna's Elo code](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lm-sys/FastChat/833d65032a715240a3978f4a8f08e7a496c83cb1/fastchat/serve/monitor/elo_analysis.py). The Elo rating parameters used were K=8 and an initial rating of 1000.

比较长的Discription：

We collected a supervised fine-tuning dataset consists of textbooks, guidelines, EHR, medical & generic domain instruction tuning data, Q&A data, multi-round dialog data. The dataset comprises an extensive collection of 4,000,000 data samples, which is equivalent to approximately 9.6 billion tokens. 
We also designed a online labeling tool for the reinforcement learning data collection and had qualified experts from various hospital departments to score and rank the responses generated by the model.

PULSE is trained on these two datasets. A self-evaluation prompt is added in the reward model training and standard PPO framework are further optimized for better performance. Plugins for the downstream applications are under development.
